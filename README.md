# todo_list

A To Do app I created to practice Flutter. I started by following Daniel Ciolfi's tutorial, and after the tutorial ended I kept updating the app, refactoring and adding my own functionality. The app consisted only in a `main.dart` file, so I decided to better organize it with different files for views, widgets and controlling. Then I added the features of changing the app's main color and also editing existing To dos.

# features

- [X] Create To dos
- [X] Edit existing To dos
- [X] Delete To dos
- [X] Change the app's main color
- [X] Persist changes

## Installation and usage

To run the app on debug mode, use the command `flutter run`. Be sure you have installed Flutter and the Android SDK. If this is your first time with flutter, below are some useful resources:

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)
